🕒 Countdown Timer (Python GUI Project)

📘 Project Overview

The Countdown Timer is a simple yet useful Python project built using Tkinter.
It allows you to set a timer, pause/resume, and reset the countdown — all through a clean graphical interface.
Once the timer reaches zero, it plays a sound alert and displays a “Time’s Up!” message.

This project is a great way to learn about:

• Using Tkinter for GUI applications in Python
• Handling events and time using after()
• Adding audio alerts and button controls

🧠 Features:

✅ User-friendly GUI interface
✅ Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset buttons
✅ Displays the remaining time dynamically
✅ Sound alert when countdown ends
✅ Input validation for invalid or negative values

🧩 Technologies Used:

• Python 3.x
• Tkinter (for GUI)
• winsound (for sound alert – Windows)

💡 For Mac/Linux users, you can replace the winsound.Beep() with a simple print('\\a') or use a library like playsound.

⚙️ How to Run:

1) Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/countdown-timer.git
cd countdown-timer

2) Run the Python script:

python countdown_timer_gui.py

📌 Enter time in seconds, then click Start.
📌 Click Pause to pause the timer.
📌 Click Resume to continue.
📌 Click Reset to restart the timer.

🪄 Example:

Input: 120
Output: Timer starts from 02:00 and counts down to 00:00, then shows a message box saying “Time’s Up!” and plays a short beep sound.

💡 Future Improvements

🌟 Add custom alarm sounds
🌟 Add dark/light mode toggle
🌟 Create a count-up (stopwatch) version
🌟 Save preset timers (like 5 min, 10 min)
